# 🌟 XPOptimizer

**XPOptimizer** is designed to optimize the handling of XP orbs by merging nearby ones into one. This reduces lag caused by excessive XP orbs in farms or other high-yield XP environments. The plugin provides flexible control to enable or disable the feature globally.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. 🔗 It merges nearby XP orbs into a single orb with the combined XP value.
2. 🎲 When XP orbs spawn, the plugin scans for other orbs nearby within a radius.
3. 🛠️ The merging reduces the number of entities on the server, improving performance in high-yield XP areas.
